Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Spiral and Wave Drawings
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify whether a patient has Parkinson’s disease based on images of spirals and waves drawn by the patient. The dataset consists of images of spirals and waves, which are unique drawings made by Parkinson’s patients and healthy individuals. The goal is to develop an AI model that can automatically detect early signs of Parkinson's disease using image analysis.

Project Overview
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. Early detection is crucial for managing the disease. In this project, we build a deep learning model to classify whether an individual has Parkinson’s disease based on images they draw. This model can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and better management of the disease.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language.
TensorFlow / Keras: For building and training the CNN model.
OpenCV: For image processing and manipulation.
Matplotlib: For visualizing results.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Dataset
The dataset consists of images of spirals and waves drawn by both Parkinson’s patients and healthy individuals. These drawings are used as a diagnostic tool for early-stage Parkinson's detection. The dataset can be found here (or you can upload your own dataset).

Installation Instructions
To run this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/parkinsons-disease-detection.git
cd parkinsons-disease-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the Data: Ensure the dataset is stored in the appropriate folder and is in the correct format.

Train the Model: Run the following command to start training the CNN model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Evaluate the Model: Once trained, evaluate the model's performance on a test set:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict whether a new image belongs to a Parkinson's patient or not:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
Model Details
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras. The CNN architecture consists of several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function for binary classification (Parkinson’s disease vs. healthy).

Data Augmentation
To improve the model's robustness and generalization, extensive data augmentation techniques were applied, including:

Rotation
Scaling
Horizontal and vertical flipping
Random cropping
This helped increase the diversity of training data and reduced overfitting.

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. Further fine-tuning and model optimization can improve this result. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are available in the evaluation script.
